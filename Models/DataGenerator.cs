It takes the shape of a small, striated cylinder up to five centimeters in height with a depression at the top. A specialty of the Bordeaux region of France, today it is widely available in pâtisseries in France and abroad. The canelé is believed to originate from the Couvent des Annonciades, Bordeaux in either the 15th or the 18th century.[1][2] (Though the article about this same pastry in the French Wikipedia Canelé says Différentes théories tentent de construire une histoire plus ancienne mais manquent totalement de fondement.Different theories attempt to construct a more ancient history but lack any foundation whatever.) The modern word canelé originates in Gascon, which was spoken in Bordeaux and a large area of southwestern France until the 19th century.[3] In Limoges, there was a food called canole, a bread made with flour and egg yolks, which may be the same item as that sold in Bordeaux since the 18th century under the name of canaule, also written canaulé or canaulet. Artisans known as canauliers who specialized in baking them registered a Corporation (or guild) with the Parliament of Bordeaux in 1663, which allowed only them to produce several specific foods: Blessed bread, canaules, and Retortillons. Since they were not a part of the Pastry Corporation (Guild), which had a monopoly over baking with milk and sugar or mixtionnée dough, they were prohibited from using those ingredients. The canauliers disputed the Pastry Chefs' privileges and on 3 March 1755 the council of State in Versailles ruled for the canauliers and ended the Pastry Chefs' monopoly. An edict of 1767 limited the number of authorized canaulier shops in a city to eight. It created very strict requirements for joining the profession. Nevertheless, in 1785 there were at least 39 canaulier shops in Bordeaux, at least ten of which were in the district (faubourg) of Saint-Seurin. The French Revolution abolished all the Corporations, but later census rolls continue to show shops of Canauliers and bakers of blessed bread. In the first quarter of the 20th century the canelé reappeared, even if it is difficult to date exactly when. An unknown pastry chef re-popularised the antique recipe of canauliers. He added rum and vanilla to his dough. It is likely that its current shape comes from the similarity (in French) of the word wave with the word 'cannelure' (fluting, corrugation, striations). The modern name 'canelé' is of recent origin. The Guide Gourmand de la France[4] does not mention it. Only in 1985, after the pastry's popularity had begun to explode, was the Brotherhood of the Canelé of Bordeaux (Confrérie du Canelé de Bordeaux)[5] created and the second 'n' of its name removed. The name canelé became a collective brand,[2][6] registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property of France by the Brotherhood. Ten years after the registration of the brand, there were at least 800 manufacturers in Aquitaine and 600 in the Gironde. In 1992, Gironde alone consumed an estimated 4.5 million canelés.",

There are different recipes, but what they all have in common is a portrait of the king on top, made in chocolate or marzipan. Gustavus Adolphus pastry[1] (Swedish: Gustaf Adolfsbakelse) is a pastry traditionally eaten every 6 November in Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus Day, the death day of King Gustavus Adolphus the Great. It is especially popular in Gothenburg, a city founded by the king.[2] The pastry was created around 1900. Candy with the image of the king was sold by a konditorei in Gothenburg since the 1850s.[2] The earliest mention of a pastry is from the Western parts of Sweden during the 1890s,[2][3] where the pastry probably was created around the festivities when a statue of the king was erected in Gothenburg on a square, that since then is known as Gustaf Adolfs torg[2][4] ('Gustavus Adolphus Square'). One Gothenburg bakery, Bräutigams, claims to have created it in the early 20th century, with the years 1905 or 1909 mentioned.[4][5][6] Recipes for the pastry vary locally but most versions have a portrait of the king on the top, usually made of chocolate or marzipan.[2] In 2003, a competition arranged by Livrustkammaren and Gastronomiska akademien ('Gastronomic Academy of Sweden') elected a winner without the king's portrait.[7] The Swedish bakeries and konditoreis however preferred their old versions,[8] so the attempt to establish a standard Gustavus Adolphus pastry failed. Exactly how many Gustav Adolphus pastries are sold in November each year is not known. The newspaper Göteborgs-Tidningen in 2009 approximated the total Swedish sales and consumption to more than 10 000.[4]",

Recipes are found in 10th–13th-century Arab cookery books, under the names sanbusak, sanbusaq, and sanbusaj, all deriving from the Persian word sanbosag.

The best-known strudels are Apfelstrudel (German for apple strudel) and Topfenstrudel (with sweet soft quark, in Austrian German Topfen), followed by the Millirahmstrudel (Milk-cream strudel, Milchrahmstrudel). Other strudel types include sour cherry (Weichselstrudel), sweet cherry, nut filled (Nussstrudel), Apricot Strudel, Plum Strudel, poppy seed strudel (Mohnstrudel), and raisin strudel.[7] There are also savoury strudels incorporating spinach, cabbage, potato, pumpkin, and sauerkraut,[8] and versions containing meat fillings like the Lungenstrudel or Fleischstrudel. Traditional strudel pastry differs from puff pastry in that it is very elastic. It is made[9] from flour with a high gluten content, water, oil and salt, with no sugar added. The dough is worked vigorously, rested, and then rolled out and stretched by hand very thinly with the help of a clean linen tea towel[10] or kitchen paper.[11] There are numerous techniques for manually pulling strudel dough. One method is to roll the dough thin before laying it over the back of the hands and drawing it thin by pulling the hands apart from one another.[12] Purists say that it should be so thin that you can read a newspaper through it. A legend has it that the Austrian Emperor's perfectionist cook decreed that it should be possible to read a love letter through it. The thin dough is laid out on a tea towel, and the filling is spread on it. The dough with the filling on top is rolled up carefully with the help of the tea towel and baked in the oven.",

Pineapple cakes have become one of the top-selling souvenirs in Taiwan. Since 2005, the Taipei City Government has run an annual Taipei Pineapple Cake Cultural Festival to foster the growth the local tourism industry and promote sales of the pineapple cake.[5][6] In 2013, the revenue from Taiwan's pineapple cake bakeries totaled NT$40 billion (US$1.2 billion), and sales of pineapple cakes have also bolstered agricultural economies in rural parts of the country.
